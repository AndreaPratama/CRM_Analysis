# CRM & Sales Pipeline Analysis

![](crm_hero_new.jpg)

## Introduction
This project is part of the FP20 Analytics Challenge 17, focusing on CRM and sales pipeline data analysis to derive actionable insights. The challenge involves examining sales performance, conversion rates, sales pipeline health, and forecasting future trends using advanced data analytics techniques.

## Problem Statement
The primary objective of this project is to address the following business questions:
1. Who are the top-performing sales agents?
2. What are the conversion rates from leads to paying customers in different countries?
3. How does sales performance vary across different industries?
4. How healthy is the sales pipeline month-over-month, considering the number of leads at each stage of the sales funnel?
5. What is the average time taken by sales agents to respond to new leads, and how does it impact conversion rates?
6. What are the trends in average deal values? Are there noticeable fluctuations?
7. Based on current pipeline data and historical trends, forecast potential income for the next few months.
8. Does the size of the organization affect the sales cycle duration and deal value?
9. How effective are sales strategies for different products offered (e.g., SAAS vs. other product types)?
10. Assess the time taken from lead acquisition to deal closure. Which factors influence the duration of the sales cycle?
11. Investigate the common characteristics of lost opportunities and how these reasons vary by industry or country.
12. How accurate are the sales forecasts in terms of expected versus actual close dates?

## Data Sourcing
The dataset used in this project is provided as part of the FP20 Analytics Challenge 17. The dataset contains anonymized CRM and sales pipeline information, including details about leads, deals, sales agents, industries, countries, and more. The dataset is utilized to analyze sales performance, conversion rates, sales pipeline health, response times, deal values, and other key metrics in the sales domain.

## Data Transformation
Data transformation involved the following steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and correcting inconsistencies.
2. **Data Aggregation**: Summarizing data by month, sales agent, industry, and country.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features such as month-over-month changes, response times, and sales cycle duration.

## Modeling
The project involved creating various models to derive insights:
1. **Descriptive Models**: To understand current and historical sales performance.
2. **Predictive Models**: Using historical data to forecast future sales trends and potential income.
3. **Diagnostic Models**: Analyzing factors influencing sales performance, conversion rates, and deal values.

In this project, I created a calendar table to facilitate time-based analysis. The calendar table contains information about dates, months, years, quarters, and more, which allows for better data analysis based on time dimensions. The calendar table is also used to create time relationships in the data model.

And Create Relationship between Date Table and Fact Table
